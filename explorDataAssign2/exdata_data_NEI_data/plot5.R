# plot 5:How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed 
#from 1999â€“2008 in Baltimore City?
library(ggplot2)

# extract data: what does mobile vehicle sources means? Run the following line
unique(dt_SCC$EI.Sector[grep("On-Road", dt_SCC$EI.Sector)])
# returns:
# [1] Mobile - On-Road Gasoline Light Duty Vehicles Mobile - On-Road Gasoline Heavy Duty Vehicles
# [3] Mobile - On-Road Diesel Light Duty Vehicles   Mobile - On-Road Diesel Heavy Duty Vehicles  
# 59 Levels: Agriculture - Crops & Livestock Dust ... Waste Disposal
# so on-road type is equivalent to mobile vehicle. Therefore we just need to extract
# type=on-road data in dt_NEI
setkey(dt_NEI, fips, type)
baltimoreData = dt_NEI[J("24510", "ON-ROAD")] # select city and pollution type
baltimoreYearly_Emission = 
    baltimoreData[,lapply(.SD, sum), 
                  .SDcol=("Emissions"),by=c("year")] # group and sum data

# begin to plot

# Conclusion:
# From the plot, we have the result that the motor vehicle sources decreases
# from 1999 to 2008
